<h1>1 STDLIB Release Notes</h1>
  
  <p>This document describes the changes made to the STDLIB application.</p>
<h3><a name="id2314868">1.1 
        STDLIB 1.16.4</a></h3>
    <h4>Improvements and New Features</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
	    The documentation is now built with open source tools
	    (xsltproc and fop) that exists on most platforms. One
	    visible change is that the frames are removed.</p>
          <p>
	    Own Id: OTP-8201</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
	    [escript] The restriction that the first line in escripts
	    must begin with <span class="code">#!</span> has been removed.</p>
          <p>
	    [escript] Some command line options to the escript
	    executable has now been documented. For example you can
	    run an escript in the debugger by just adding a command
	    line option.</p>
          <p>
	    [escript] The documentation of the escript header syntax
	    has been clarified. For example the header is optional.
	    This means that it is possible to directly "execute"
	    <span class="code">.erl</span>, <span class="code">.beam</span> and<span class="code">.zip</span> files.</p>
          <p>
	    Own Id: OTP-8215</p>
        </li>
        <li>
	    <p>Optimized array:from_orddict/1, it is now faster and
	    uses less memory if the orddict was sparse.</p>
	    <p>Changed array:reset/2, it will now never expand the
	    array which it could before for non fixed arrays. See the
	    documentation.</p>
          <p>
	    Own Id: OTP-8216</p>
        </li>
        <li>
	    <p>The Erlang Pretty Printer (<span class="code">erl_pp</span>) now puts the
	    leading <span class="code">[</span> of list comprehensions as well as the
	    leading <span class="code">&lt;&lt;</span> of bit string comprehensions on a
	    separate line in order to expose the Cover counter of the
	    template.</p>
          <p>
	    Own Id: OTP-8227</p>
        </li>
        <li>
	    <p>The extension ".xrl" used for Leex input files is now
	    recognized by the compiler.</p>
          <p>
	    Own Id: OTP-8232</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
	    Some clarifications have been made in the documentation
	    regarding <span class="code">gen_server</span>, <span class="code">gen_fsm</span>, and
	    <span class="code">gen_event</span> behavior when handling <span class="code">'EXIT'</span>
	    messages from the parent process. For more information
	    see the <span class="bold_code">
<a href="../../man/gen_server.html">gen_server(3)</a></span>, <span class="bold_code">
<a href="../../man/gen_fsm.html">gen_fsm(3)</a></span>, and <span class="bold_code">
<a href="../../man/gen_event.html">gen_event(3)</a></span> documentation.</p>

        </li>
        <li>
	    <p>The -on_load() directive can be used to run a function
	    when a module is loaded. It is documented in the section
	    about code loading in the Reference Manual.</p>

<h3><a name="id2315176">1.2 
        STDLIB 1.16.3.1</a></h3>
    <h4>Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            An erroneous type spec for <span class="code">gen:start/6</span> caused
            dialyzer to erroneously issue warnings when
            <span class="code">{spawn_opt, SpawnOptionList}</span> was passed in the
            option list to the <span class="code">gen_server</span> and <span class="code">gen_fsm</span>
            start functions.</p>

<h3><a name="id2315223">1.3 
        STDLIB 1.16.3</a></h3>
    <h4>Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
	    <p>The linter used to crash on invalid <span class="code">-opaque</span>
	    declarations.</p>
          <p>
	    Own Id: OTP-8051</p>
        </li>
        <li>
	    <p>Bugs in <span class="code">digraph:add_edge/5</span> and
	    <span class="code">digraph:del_path/3</span> have been fixed. (Thanks to
	    Crystal Din.)</p>
          <p>
	    Own Id: OTP-8066</p>
        </li>
        <li>
	    <p>When trying to insert objects with
	    <span class="code">dets:insert_new()</span> into a Dets table of type
	    <span class="code">duplicate_bag</span>, already existing objects would
	    sometimes be duplicated. This bug has been fixed. (Thanks
	    to Crystal Din.)</p>
          <p>
	    Own Id: OTP-8070</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
	    Running erlc in a very deep directory (with a path length
	    of more 256 or more characters) would cause the emulator
	    to crash in a call to <span class="code">list_to_atom/1</span>. (Thanks to
	    Chris Newcombe.)</p>
          <p>
	    Own Id: OTP-8124</p>
        </li>
        <li>
	    <p>A few minor bugs have been fixed in the Erlang Code
	    Preprocessor (<span class="code">epp</span>).</p>
          <p>
	    Own Id: OTP-8130</p>
        </li>
        <li>
	    <p>A bug in The Erlang Meta Interpreter (<span class="code">erl_eval</span>)
	    has been fixed: exceptions generated in the template of
	    bit string comprehensions were not handled properly.
	    (Thanks to Ulf Wiger.)</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
	    Option <span class="code">{capture,none}</span> was missing in documentation
	    for <span class="code">re:run/3</span>.</p>
          <p>
	    Own Id: OTP-8113</p>
        </li>
        <li>
	    <p>When <span class="code">erl_scan:tokens()</span> returns an error tuple
	    <span class="code">{error, ErrorInfo, EndLocation</span>}, the list
	    <span class="code">LeftOverChars</span> is the remaining characters of the
	    input data, starting from <span class="code">EndLocation</span>. It used to

        <li>
	    <p>The Erlang Meta Interpreter (<span class="code">erl_eval</span>) has been
	    somewhat optimized when it comes to interpreting
	    <span class="code">receive</span>-expressions. (Thanks to Richard
	    Carlsson.)</p>

        <li>
	    <p>The text of tokens returned by the Erlang scanner
	    (<span class="code">erl_scan</span>) was sometimes empty when the

        <li>
	    <p>The documentation for <span class="code">base64:decode/1</span> has been
	    updated to point out that it strips whitespace.</p>
	    <p><span class="code">base64:decode/1</span> and <span class="code">base64:mime_decode/1</span>
	    would sometimes fail instead of stripping away non-base64

    <h4>Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
	    <p>Fixed a minor race conditions in

	    could still be registered (either locally or in
	    <span class="code">global</span>).</p>
	    <p>A process started by <span class="code">proc_lib</span> in some cases
	    depended on its process dictionary not to be erased, and
	    would crash when terminating abnormally and not generate
	    a proper crash report. This has been corrected (but the
	    initial call will not be shown in the error report if the
	    process dictionary has been erased). NOTE: There is no
	    longer any need to erase the process dictionary for
	    memory conservation reasons, since the actual call
	    arguments are no longer saved in the process
	    dictionary.</p>

	    <p>Support for Unicode is implemented as described in
	    EEP10. Formatting and reading of unicode data both from
	    terminals and files is supported by the io and io_lib
	    modules. Files can be opened in modes with automatic
	    translation to and from different unicode formats. The
	    module 'unicode' contains functions for conversion
	    between external and internal unicode formats and the re
	    module has support for unicode data. There is also
	    language syntax for specifying string and character data
	    beyond the ISO-latin-1 range.</p>
	    <p>The interactive shell will support input and output of
	    unicode characters when the terminal and operating system
	    supports it.</p>
	    <p>Please see the EEP and the io/io_lib manual pages as
	    well as the stdlib users guide for details.</p>
	    <p><strong>I/O-protocol incompatibilities:</strong></p>
	    <p>The io_protocol between io_Server and client is
	    updated to handle protocol data in unicode formats. The
	    updated protocol is now documented. The specification
	    resides in the stdlib <strong>users manual</strong>, which is a
	    new part of the manual.</p>
	    <p><strong>io module incompatibilities:</strong></p>
	    <p>The io:put_chars, io:get_chars and io:get_line all
	    handle and return unicode data. In the case where
	    binaries can be provided (as to io:put_chars), they shall
	    be encoded in UTF-8. When binaries are returned (as by
	    io:get_line/get_chars when the io_server is set in
	    <strong>binary mode</strong>) the returned data is also
	    <strong>always</strong> encoded as UTF-8. The file module however
	    still returns byte-oriented data, why file:read can be
	    used instead of io:get_chars to read binary data in
	    ISO-latin-1.</p>
	    <p><strong>io_lib module incompatibilities:</strong></p>
	    <p>io_lib:format can, given new format directives (i.e
	    "~ts" and "~tc"), return lists containing integers larger
	    than 255. </p>

	    <p>The <span class="code">queue</span> module has been rewritten to make it
	    easier to use. Suggestions and discussion from and with
	    among others Lev Walkin, Anders Ramsell and Rober Virding
	    in december 2007 on erlang-questions@erlang.org. It was
	    also discussed to change the internal representation to
	    contain length information which would speed up
	    <span class="code">len/1</span> but that change has been postponed. Anyone
	    interested may write an EEP and try to reach an
	    acceptable compromise for queue overhead and thereby the
	    speed of all other operations than <span class="code">len/1</span>. The
	    <span class="code">queue</span> module is now optimized for fast and minimal
	    garbage <span class="code">in/2</span> and <span class="code">out/1</span> and such. See the

	    option of <span class="code">qlc:table/2</span> to <span class="code">undefined</span> could
	    cause a crash.</li> <li>If a QLC restricted some
	    column of a table in such a way that a traversal using a
	    match specification was possible and the QLC also
	    compared the key column or some indexed column of the the
	    table with a column of some other table, <span class="code">qlc</span>
	    always chose to traverse the table first, never
	    considering lookup join. This has been changed so that
	    lookup join is always preferred; if an initial traversal
	    using the match specification is desired, the query needs
	    to be rewritten introducing an extra QLC with the
	    filter(s) restricting the column.</li> <li>When
	    trying to find candidates for match specifications and
	    lookup, filters using variables from one generator only
	    are ignored unless they are placed immediately after the
	    generator and possibly other filters using variables from
	    the same generator. In particular, filters joining two

	    filters using the generator only.</li> <li>The

	    <p>The behaviour of the internal functions gen:call/3,4
	    has been changed slightly in the rare case that when the
	    caller was linked to the called server, and the server
	    crashed during the call; its exit signal was consumed by
	    the gen:call/3,4 code and converted to an exit exception.
	    This exit signal is no longer consumed.</p>
	    <p>To even notice this change, 1) the calling process has
	    to be linked to the called server.</p>
          <p>
	    2) the call must not be remote by name that is it must be
	    local or remote by pid, local by name or global by name.</p>

          <p>
	    4) the server has to crash during the call.</p>

	    5) the calling process has to be sensitive to getting
	    previously consumed <span class="code">{'EXIT',Pid,Reason}</span> messages
	    in its message queue.</p>
	    <p>The old behaviour was once the only way for a client
	    to notice if the server died, but has since
	    <span class="code">erlang:monitor(process, {Name,Node})</span> was

          <p>Support for faster join of two tables has been added
            to the <span class="code">qlc</span> module. There are two kinds of fast
            joins: lookup join that uses existing indices, and merge
            join that takes two sorted inputs. There is a new
            <span class="code">join</span> option that can be used to force QLC to use a
            particular kind of join in some QLC expression.</p>
          <p>Several other changes have also been included:</p>
          <p></p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>The new <span class="code">tmpdir</span> option of <span class="code">cursor/2</span>,
                <span class="code">eval/2</span>, <span class="code">fold/4</span>, and <span class="code">info/2</span> can be
                used to set the directory that join uses for temporary
                files. The option also overrides the <span class="code">tmpdir</span> option
                of <span class="code">keysort/3</span> and <span class="code">sort/2</span>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>The new <span class="code">lookup</span> option can be used to
                assert that constants are looked up when evaluating some
                QLC expression.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>The <span class="code">cache</span> and <span class="code">cache_all</span> options
                accept new tags: <span class="code">ets</span>, <span class="code">list</span>, and <span class="code">no</span>.
                The tag <span class="code">list</span> caches answers in a list using a
                temporary file if the answers cannot be held in RAM.
                Combining <span class="code">{cache,list}</span> and <span class="code">{unique, true}</span>
                is equivalent to calling <span class="code">sort/2</span> with the option
                <span class="code">unique</span> set to <span class="code">true</span>. The old tags
                <span class="code">true</span> (equivalent to <span class="code">ets</span>) and <span class="code">false</span>
                (equivalent to <span class="code">no</span>) are recognized for backward
                compatibility.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>The new option <span class="code">max_list_size</span> can be used
                to set the limit where merge join starts to use temporary
                files for large equivalence classes and when answers
                cached in lists are put on temporary files.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>There is a new callback <span class="code">is_sorted_key</span> to
                be supplied as an option to <span class="code">table/2</span>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>QLC analyzes each and every QLC expression when
                trying to find constants for the lookup function.
                Hitherto only QLC expressions with exactly one generator
                were analyzed.</p>
              <p>Note that only filters with guard
                syntax placed immediately after the generator are
                analyzed. The restriction to guard filters is an
                incompatible change. See <span class="code">qlc(3)</span> for further
                details.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>In a similar way several match specifications
                for traversal of QLC tables can be utilized for different
                generators of one single QLC expression.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>A bug has been fixed: when caching answers to a
                sufficiently complex query it could happen that some
                answers were not returned.</p>

        <li>
          <p>To help Dialyzer find more bugs, many functions in the
            Kernel and STDLIB applications now only accept arguments
            of the type that is documented.</p>
          <p>For instance, the functions <span class="code">lists:prefix/2</span> and
            <span class="code">lists:suffix/2</span> are documented to only accept lists
            as their arguments, but they actually accepted anything
            and returned <span class="code">false</span>. That has been changed so that
            the functions cause an exception if one or both arguments
            are not lists.</p>
          <p>Also, the <span class="code">string:strip/3</span> function is documented
            to take a character argument that is a character to strip
            from one or both ends of the string. Given a list instead
            of a character, it used to do nothing, but will now cause
            an exception.</p>
          <p>Dialyzer will find most cases where those functions
            are passed arguments of the wrong type.</p>

            and the absolute value of the float to print was lower
            than 10^4 but 10^(P-1) or higher. Now it will not crash

            original intention, not as <span class="code">gb_sets:delete/2</span>. Code
            that relies on <span class="code">gb_sets:del_element/2</span> causing an
            error if the element does not exist must be changed to
            call <span class="code">gb_sets:delete/2</span> instead.</p>
          <p>The documentation was also updated to explicitly
            document functions that were only referred to as
            'aliases' of a documented function. Also, a list of all
            functions common to the <span class="code">gb_sets</span>, <span class="code">sets</span>, and

          <p>The top level group leader used to be listed as job #1 in
            the job list in JCL mode. Since there is no shell

            will no longer be listed.</p>

          <p>The possibility to start the Erlang shell in parallel
            with the rest of the system has been reintroduced for
            backwards compatibility. Note that this old behaviour is
            error prone and should not be used unless for some reason
            necessary.</p>
