  <h3><a name="id2260500">2.1 
        Overview</a></h3>
    
    <p>The two major components of the Event Tracer (ET)
      tool is a graphical sequence chart viewer (<span class="code">et_viewer</span>)
      and its backing storage (<span class="code">et_collector</span>). One collector
      may be used as backing storage for several simultaneous
      viewers where each one may display a different view of
      the same trace data.</p>
    <p>The interface between the collector and its viewers
      is public in order to enable other types of viewers.
      However in the following text we will focus on usage
      of the <span class="code">et_viewer</span>.</p>
    <p>The main start function is <span class="code">et_viewer:start/1</span>.
      It will by default start both an <span class="code">et_collector</span> and
      an <span class="code">et_viewer</span>:</p>
    <p></p>
    <div class="example"><pre>
         % erl -pa et/examples
         Erlang (BEAM) emulator version 2002.10.08 [source]
         Eshell V2002.10.08  (abort with ^G)
         1&gt; {ok, Viewer} = et_viewer:start([]).
         {ok,&lt;0.31.0&gt;}
    </pre></div>
    <p>A viewer gets trace events from its collector
      by polling it regularly for more events to display.
      Trace events are for example reported to the collector with
      <span class="code">et_collector:report_event/6</span>:</p>
    <div class="example"><pre>
         2&gt; Collector = et_viewer:get_collector_pid(Viewer).
         &lt;0.30.0&gt;
         3&gt; et_collector:report_event(Collector, 60, my_shell, mnesia_tm, start_outer, 
                                      "Start outer transaction"),
         3&gt; et_collector:report_event(Collector, 40, mnesia_tm, my_shell, new_tid, 
                                      "New transaction id is 4711"),
         3&gt; et_collector:report_event(Collector, 20, my_shell, mnesia_locker, try_write_lock,
                                      "Acquire write lock for {my_tab, key}"),
         3&gt; et_collector:report_event(Collector, 10, mnesia_locker, my_shell, granted, 
                                      "You got the write lock for {my_tab, key}"),
         3&gt; et_collector:report_event(Collector, 60, my_shell, do_commit, 
                                      "Perform  transaction commit"),
         3&gt; et_collector:report_event(Collector, 40, my_shell, mnesia_locker, release_tid, 
                                      "Release all locks for transaction 4711"),
         3&gt; et_collector:report_event(Collector, 60, my_shell, mnesia_tm, delete_transaction, 
                                      "End of outer transaction"),
         3&gt; et_collector:report_event(Collector, 20, my_shell, end_outer, 
                                      "Transaction returned {atomic, ok}").
         {ok,{table_handle,&lt;0.30.0&gt;,11,trace_ts,#Fun&lt;et_collector.0.83904657&gt;}}
         4&gt;        
    </pre></div>
    <p>This is a simulation of the process events caused by a Mnesia
      transaction that writes a record in a local table:</p>
    <div class="example"><pre>
         mnesia:transaction(fun() -&gt; mnesia:write({my_tab, key, val}) end).
    </pre></div>
    <p>At this stage when we have a couple of events, it is time to
      show how it looks like in the graphical interface of
      <span class="code">et_viewer</span>:</p>

    <p>In the sequence chart, the actors (which symbolically has performed the
      traced event) are shown as named vertical bars. The order of the
      actors may be altered by dragging (hold mouse button 1 pressed during
      the operation) the name tag of an actor and drop it elsewhere:</p>

    <p>An event may be an action performed by one single actor (blue
      text label) or it may involve two actors and is then depicted as an
      arrow directed from one actor to another (red text label). Details of
      an event can be shown by clicking (press and release the mouse button 1)
      on the event label text or on the arrow:</p>

  <h3><a name="id2257323">2.2 
        Filters and dictionary</a></h3>
    
    <p>The Event Tracer (ET) uses named filters in various
      contexts. An Event Trace filter is an <span class="code">Erlang fun</span>
      that takes some trace data as input and returns a possibly
      modified version of it:
      </p>
    <p></p>
    <div class="example"><pre>
         filter(TraceData) -&gt; true | {true, NewEvent} | false
         TraceData = NewEvent | term()
         NewEvent  = record(event)
    </pre></div>
    <p>The interface of the filter function is the same as the the
      filter functions for the good old <span class="code">lists:zf/2</span>. If the filter
      returns <span class="code">false</span> it means that the <span class="code">TraceData</span> should be
      dropped. <span class="code">{true, NewEvent}</span> means that the <span class="code">TraceData</span>
      should be replaced with <span class="code">NewEvent</span>. And <span class="code">true</span> means that the
      <span class="code">TraceData</span> data already is an event record and that it
      should be kept as it is.
      </p>
    <p>The first filter that the trace data is exposed for is
      the collector filter. When a trace event is reported with
      <span class="code">et_collector:report/2</span> (or <span class="code">et_collector:report_event/5,6</span>)
      the first thing that
      happens, is that a message is sent to the collector process
      to fetch a handle that contains some useful stuff, such as
      the collector filter fun and an ets table identifier.
      Then the collector filter fun is applied and if it returns
      <span class="code">true</span> (or <span class="code">{true, NewEvent}</span>), the event will
      be stored in an ets table. As an optimization, subsequent
      calls to <span class="code">et_collector:report</span>-functions can use the handle
      directly instead of the collector pid.
      </p>
    <p>The collector filter (that is the filter named
      <span class="code">collector</span>) is a little bit special, as its input
      may be any Erlang term and is not limited to take an event
      record as the other filter functions. 
      </p>
    <p>The collector manages a key/value based dictionary, where
      the filters are stored. Updates of the dictionary is
      propagated to all subscribing processes. When a viewer is
      started it is registered as a subscriber of dictionary updates.
      </p>
    <p>In a viewer there is only one filter that is active
      and all trace events that the viewer gets from the
      collector will pass thru that filter. By writing clever
      filters it is possible to customize how the events
      looks like in the viewer. The following filter replaces
      the actor names <span class="code">mnesia_tm</span> and <span class="code">mnesia_locker</span>
      and leaves everything else in the record as it was:
      </p>
    <p></p>
    
    <p>If we now add the filter to the running collector:
      </p>
    <p></p>
    <div class="example"><pre>
        4&gt; Fun = fun(E) -&gt; et_demo:mgr_actors(E) end.
        #Fun&lt;erl_eval.5.123085357&gt;
        5&gt; et_collector:dict_insert(Collector, {filter, mgr_actors}, Fun).
        ok
        6&gt;
    </pre></div>
    <p>you will see that the <span class="code">Filter</span> menu in all viewers have
      got a new entry called <span class="code">mgr_actors</span>. Select it, and a new
      viewer window will pop up:</p>
    <p></p>

      <em>Figure
        2.4:
         
        The same trace data in a different view</em>
    
    <p>In order to see the nitty gritty details of an event
      you may click on the event in order to start a contents
      viewer for that event. In the contents viewer there is
      also a filter menu in order to enable inspection of the
      event from other views than the one selected in the viewer.
      A click on the <span class="code">new_tid</span> event will cause a contents
      viewer window to pop up, showing the event in the 
      <span class="code">mgr_actors</span> view:</p>

    <p>Select the <span class="code">collector</span> entry in the <span class="code">Filters</span>
      menu and a new contents viewer window will pop up
      showing the same trace event in the collectors view:</p>

  <h3><a name="id2254004">2.3 
        Trace clients</a></h3>
    
    <p>As you have seen it is possible to use the
      <span class="code">et_collector:report</span>-functions explicitly. By using those functions
      you can write your own trace client that reads trace data from any
      source stored in any format and just feed the collector with it. You
      may replace the default collector filter with a filter that converts
      new exciting trace data formats to event-records or you may convert it
      to an event-record before you invoke <span class="code">et_collector:report/2</span> and
      then rely on the default collector filter to handle the new
      format.</p>
    <p>There are also existing functions in the API that reads from
      various sources and calls <span class="code">et_collector:report/2</span>:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>The trace events that are hosted by the collector may be 
          stored to file and later be loaded by selecting <span class="code">save</span>
          and <span class="code">load</span> entries in the viewers <span class="code">File</span>-menu or
          via the <span class="code">et_collector</span> API.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>It is also possible to perform live tracing of a running
          system by making use of the built-in trace support in
          the Erlang emulator. These Erlang traces can be directed
          to files or to ports. See the reference manual for
          <span class="code">erlang:trace/4</span>, <span class="code">erlang:trace_pattern/3</span>,
          <span class="code">dbg</span> and <span class="code">ttb</span> for more info.</p>
        <p>There are also corresponding trace client types that can
          read the Erlang trace data format from such files or ports.
          The <span class="code">et_collector:start_trace_client/3</span> function makes
          use of these Erlang trace clients and redirects the trace
          data to the collector.</p>
        <p>The default collector filter converts the Erlang trace data
          format into event-records.If you want to perform this
          differently you can of course write your own collector
          filter from scratch. But it may probably save you some
          efforts if you first apply the default filter in 
          <span class="code">et_selector:parse_event/2</span> before you apply your
          own conversions of its output.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  
  <h3><a name="id2256620">2.4 
        Global tracing and phone home</a></h3>
    
    <p>Setting up an Erlang tracer on a set of nodes and connecting
      trace clients to the ports of these tracers is not intuitive. In order
      to make this it easier the Event Tracer as a notion of global
      tracing. When used, the <span class="code">et_collector</span> process will monitor
      Erlang nodes and when one connects, an Erlang tracer will
      automatically be started on the other node. A corresponding trace
      client will also be started on the collector node in order to
      automatically forward the trace events to the collector. Set the
      boolean parameter <span class="code">trace_global</span> to <span class="code">true</span> for either the
      <span class="code">et_collector</span> or <span class="code">et_viewer</span> in order to activate the
      global tracing. There is no restriction on how many concurrent
      (anonymous) collectors you can have, but you can only have one global
      collector as its name is registered in <span class="code">global</span>.</p>
    <p>In order to further simplify the tracing you can make use of the
      <span class="code">et:report_event/4,5</span> (or its equivalents
      <span class="code">et:phone_home/4,5</span> :-). These functions are intended to be
      invoked from other applications when there are interesting events,
      in your application that needs to be highlighted. The functions are 
      extremely light weight as they do nothing besides returning an atom.
      These functions are
      specifically designed to be traced for. As the caller explicitly
      provides the values for the event-record fields, the default collector
      filter is able to automatically provide a customized event-record
      without any user defined filter functions.</p>
    <p>In normal operation the <span class="code">et:report_event/4,5</span> calls are
      almost for free. When tracing is needed you can either activate
      tracing on these functions explicitly. Or you can combine the usage of
      <span class="code">trace_global</span> with the usage of <span class="code">trace_pattern</span>. When set,
      the <span class="code">trace_pattern</span> will automatically be activated on all
      connected nodes. </p>
    <p>One nice thing with the <span class="code">trace_pattern</span> is that it provides
      a very simple way of minimizing the amount of generated trace data by
      allowing you to explicitly control the detail level of the tracing. As
      you may have seen the <span class="code">et_viewer</span> have a slider called
      <span class="code">"Detail Level"</span> that allows you to control the detail level of the
      trace events displayed in the viewer. On the other hand if you set a
      low detail level in the <span class="code">trace_pattern</span>, lots of the trace data
      will never be generated and thus not sent over the socket to the trace
      client and stored in the collector.</p>

    <p>Almost all functionality available in the <span class="code">et_viewer</span> is
      also available via shortcuts. Which key that has the same
      effect as selecting a menu entry is shown enclosed in
      parentheses.  For example pressing the key <span class="code">r</span> is
      equivalent to selecting the menu entry
